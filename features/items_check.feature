Feature: the user can post items and check other's items

I want to check that the user can be able to post and update his/her items, and can see a list of
his/her items to sale. 

Background: things in database
    Given the following users exist:
| username        | email | password_digest     | address |
| Alex    | aaa@columbia.edu     | abc | 333 Amsterdam Ave. |
| Bill    | bbb@columbia.edu     | mypassword | 6000 W 120 St. |
